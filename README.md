To Do List
* Implement HashMap (almost done)
* Parse Document.txt and store into data structures
* Rest of stuff in "main method"
* Build frontend with switch button, form section, maybe make it so its a suggestion and tab completes it (like autosuggest)
* Connect frontend and backend (This part is kinda annoying)
* Write-up: reports, peer feedback, etc.

We got this ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’ª
