# Project Setup

## Install NodeJS
If you don't already have Node.js installed, download it from [this website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

## Clone repository
Open up the directory where you want to have the code and do:

`git clone https://github.com/raspberrysir/WritersUnblock.git`

## Install Dependencies
Install all necessary dependencies using

`npm install`

This will install all necessary libraries which are already in `package.json`.
The rest of these steps assume you are in the WritersUnblock root directory.

## Start the server
Move into the `src` folder using 

`cd writers-unblock-application/src`

Then start the server using

`node Server`

## Start the front-end
Open up a new terminal and move into the inner folder

`cd writers-unblock-application`

Then start the front-end using

`npm run start`

## Enjoy!!!
